# TODOjavaee

This is a JavaEE application that implements an pure API REST for a TODO appication. It is used for educational purposes and the goal is to show good practices when building multi-tier applications with JavaEE (and in general).

The main three tiers used are:

- REST tiers (JAX-RS)
- Business tier (EJB)
- Persistence tier (JPA)

It uses Swarm to produce an jar file than can be executed standalone without an application server.
